Hypermedia project. Part 1. Standard submission:

- **Project analysis, User profile: create a user persona for your website**

  I'm a young Computer engineer who has practically just finished his studies. For this reason half of my works aren't related with computing.

- **Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the page's information.**

  I have distributed the information in two columns; in the left column I have put the most important things: a little presentation of me, because I mean that the person who wants to hire me have to now more or less who I am and how is the person beyond their capabilities.
  Also I have talk about my studies, my most notable is the title of Computer engineer, followed by more 'basic' titles.
  The languages are not my strong; how can you check, I have a very basic English level, defending the essential; same (or maybe a little worse) as in french.
  Because I amb a 'recent graduate', the half of my last works aren't about the computing. As you can see, I have worked as a waiter in a botanical garden, as a cashier, fruiterer and replanished in a supermarket, as a manager (as a volunteer) in a very important musical event in Catalonia. This works have taught me values as punctuality, discipline and the value of money.
  Also I have worked in Aigües Blanes as a Backend programmer developing a water network (you can see the project at the end of CV) and in Rodalies de Catalunya developing an automatic system of notifications of the trains service.
  This works (and the studies) have provided me a lot of experience in languages like C++, Java, C, VHDL and R.
  Besides you can see my best research project, it's not about computing, but is about a very important topic in the universe; the exoplanets. 
  At the right column I have put my photo and my contact details

- **Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.**

  I think that my Visual Design is very simple. The reason is because a very loaded page stresses the reader. I have choosed the color blue for the background and for the arrows becouse I mean that is a very standard color that fits with many situations.
  At the top of the Curriculum you can see big my name with a blue background. Under the name, there are tho columns, both have the same design. The titles in both columns are pointed with a blue arrow who tries to be the same height as the letters of the title. I have highlighted with bold letters the most important words of every paragraph, and with italics that are the oficial name of publications and the content of the next list (ex. _Research_). 
  There are two notable differences with the two columns; the first are the width, the left one is widest than the right because have more text. The second diference is the soft blue background at the right column, the objective of this background is to separate informations and make the document a little more visual.
  Also I have choosed the black words (and not grey or other) because is clearer and most elegant than other colors.
